Data analytics project showcasing customer behavior analysis using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, SQL-based insights, and an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable business insights for decision-making.


Customer Behavior Analysis – Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow to understand customer behavior and uncover actionable insights. The process includes loading and analyzing data in Python, running analytical SQL queries, and building an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to demonstrate strong analytical thinking, technical skills, and the ability to turn raw data into meaningful business insights.

📂 Dataset

A customer transactions dataset (CSV/Excel format)

Columns include customer details, purchase information, product categories, timestamps, and revenue-related fields

Data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for use across Python, SQL, and Power BI

(You can replace this with your actual dataset description.)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn

SQL: PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server (whichever your environment supports)

Power BI: Dashboard and report creation

Gamma: Automated presentation (PPT) generation

GitHub: Version control and project documentation
